        Hi, I'm Will.  I love developing apps in React and learning how to 
        create new features.  When I'm not in the lab, you can find me performing improv comedy, teaching, or hiking the 
        White Mountains.

        I frequently use React/Redux/GraphQL, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL to build web applications.  I've also dabbled with Python and MATLAB. I enjoy the challenge of 
        learning different technologies, and I'm always looking for new things to add to the stack.
